Dataset Description
-------------------
This project uses the dataset ILPD_augmented_5000_simple.csv, which is an augmented version of the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD).
The dataset is designed for predicting whether a person is affected by liver disease based on clinical and biochemical parameters.

It contains medical information collected from patients, including liver enzyme levels, bilirubin levels, protein levels, and demographic details.

Dataset Overview
----------------
Total Records: 5000 patients
Total Features (Columns): 11
Target Variable: is_patient
Task Type: Binary Classification (Liver Disease Prediction)

Target Variable Explanation
---------------------------
The dataset is labeled with a binary outcome:

1 → Patient has liver disease
2 → Patient does not have liver disease
